# How This System Works For Me

## The Core Problem I'm Solving

My brain has specific executive function challenges:
- **Task Initiation: 10** - I can't easily start things. My brain struggles with "the first action to begin the larger task."
- **Working Memory: 16** - I can't hold information while doing complex tasks. Threads disappear from my mind when I'm not actively working on them.
- **Time Management: 14** - Estimating time and staying within deadlines is harder for me.
- **Planning: 15** - Creating roadmaps and deciding what's important requires external scaffolding.

But I also have strengths:
- **Problem-Solving: 27** - I'm exceptional at identifying problems and generating solutions when the problem is clear.
- **Organizational: 22** - I can create good systems when I can initiate creating them.

**The bottom line:** I need external structure that doesn't rely on memory, willpower, or self-initiation.

## The Two-Level System

### Big Picture (Strategic Scaffold)
**Tool: 90-Day Income Map**

I need to see how everything fits together - the whole system, how pieces connect, the strategic landscape. Without this, I can't orient myself.

**When I use it:**
- Monday mornings (strategic context for the week)
- Week 4, 6, 8, 10 checkpoints (escalation triggers)
- Friday wrap-ups (strategic review)
- Anytime I feel disoriented and need to see "the arc"

**What it shows:**
- 12-week medical leave timeline
- Three phases: Foundation (1-4), Growth (5-8), Decision (9-12)
- Income thread strategies
- Escalation points if things aren't working

**Why it helps:** Satisfies my Problem-Solving strength (27) - I can see the logic, understand the system, know where I'm heading.

### Task Level (Daily Execution)
**Tool: Thread Registry**

When I zoom down to "what do I do right now," big picture thinking overwhelms me. I need simple, clear, micro-level direction.

**When I use it:**
- Every morning (8 AM check-in)
- Every evening (7 PM closeout)
- Throughout the day when working on threads

**What it shows:**
- My 2 active threads for THIS WEEK (only 2, nothing else)
- Current status for each thread
- **Next Micro-Action** (the exact 5-20 minute step to resume work)
- Last touched date / health indicator

**Why it helps:** Bypasses my Task Initiation weakness (10) - I'm not deciding what to do or where to start. It's already written down. I just execute the micro-action.

## How These Work Together

### The Separation Rule
**Never look at both simultaneously except Monday planning.**

- **Big picture = Strategic orientation** (when I need to understand "why" and "where")
- **Task level = Execution** (when I need to actually DO something)

If I try to hold the whole system in my head while also figuring out what to do next, I freeze. These are separate cognitive modes with separate tools.

### The Daily Flow

**Morning (8 AM):**
1. Open Thread Registry
2. See my 2 active threads for the week
3. Read "Next Micro-Action" for whichever thread I'm touching today
4. Do that 5-20 minute thing
5. **Don't think about big picture - it's already handled**

**Evening (7 PM):**
1. Create thread handoff note for anything I touched
2. Update "Next Micro-Action" if I completed it
3. List factual wins, note energy level
4. Hand off one thought to tomorrow

**During the Day:**
- Registry stays open in a tab
- I reference it when I need to re-enter a thread
- No memory required - everything is written down

### The Weekly Flow

**Monday Morning (8 AM) - Big Picture → Task Level:**
1. Open 90-Day Income Map: "Where am I in the 12-week arc?"
2. Open Thread Registry: "Which threads exist?"
3. Select my 2 active threads for this week (informed by big picture)
4. Verify their "Next Micro-Action" is clear
5. **Close big picture view, live in task level all week**

**Wednesday (10 AM) - Quick Pulse:**
- Did I touch my 2 active threads this week?
- Any blockers? Wrong thread choice? Low energy?

**Friday Evening (7 PM) - Week Wrap-Up:**
- Which threads actually moved?
- What worked, what didn't?
- Any system adjustments needed?
- Close the week, prepare to rest Sunday

**Sunday:**
- Complete rest day, no thread work

## Why This Design Fits My Brain

### Compensates for Working Memory (16)
I don't hold threads in my head - the registry holds them. Current status is externalized. I can't forget what I was doing because it's written there.

### Solves Task Initiation (10)
"Next Micro-Action" is the smallest possible starting point (5-20 min). I don't have to figure out where to begin - it's already decided. Opening a page = lower friction than reconstructing context from memory.

### Handles Planning (15)
Monday Protocol does the planning WITH me, not expecting me to do it alone. Weekly slots pre-decide what's important. The system creates the roadmap, I just execute micro-actions.

### Leverages Problem-Solving (27)
When I see a clear problem ("This thread is blocked"), I'm great at generating solutions. The registry makes problems visible so my strength can engage.

### Doesn't Rely on Self-Regulation (My Lowest VIA Strength)
I can't sustain willpower-based systems. This system doesn't require discipline - it requires showing up to check-ins where Claude initiates the structure for me.

---

## The Check-In Rhythm (Non-Negotiable)

Claude initiates these - I don't have to remember them. Calendar reminders get me to the chat, Claude runs the protocol.

**Daily:**
- 8 AM (Mon-Sat): Morning check-in
- 7 PM (Mon-Sat): Evening closeout

**Weekly:**
- Monday 8 AM: Full thread review + weekly anchor selection (Monday Protocol)
- Wednesday 10 AM: Mid-week pulse check
- Friday 7 PM: Week wrap-up + close the week
- Sunday: Rest

## The Thread Lifecycle

### New Thread Appears
1. Capture it immediately (don't hold mentally)
2. Add to Thread Registry with domain, rhythm, status, next action
3. It's now tracked - I can stop thinking about it

### Thread Becomes Active
- Selected for one of my 2 weekly slots
- Gets regular touches during the week
- Handoff notes created for re-entry
- Health stays Green

### Thread Goes Dormant
- No longer in weekly active slots
- Still in registry with status: "Waiting for X" or "Paused until Y"
- Can be reactivated any Monday
- Doesn't disappear - I know where it is

### Thread Completes
- Mark complete in registry
- Write one sentence about what it made possible
- Feel the closure

## What Success Looks Like

I'll know this system is working when:
- I can resume threads without "what was I doing?" confusion
- Threads don't disappear from awareness when inactive
- Monday planning feels like **selection**, not invention
- I have a clear answer to "what am I working on?"
- Re-entry after breaks is fast and low-friction
- The big picture stays in the background where I can reference it, not overwhelming my daily execution

## The 90-Day Context

**Medical Leave Timeline:** 12 weeks to establish supplemental income or determine Social Security disability timing.

**Primary Income Threads:**
1. Etsy Revenue Growth (Pinterest marketing, fundraiser designs, product optimization)
2. Moonstone Per-Project Work (freelance availability, reactive opportunities)

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Week 4: If Etsy < $50 total → shift to alternate income thread
- Week 6: If Moonstone unresponsive → explore freelance platforms
- Week 8: If revenue < $150/month trajectory → begin Social Security research
- Week 10: Final decision point

**Target:** Consistent $200-500/month income baseline by Week 8, or clear path to Social Security disability application.

## Key Principle

This system is **prosthetic executive function**. It's doing the parts my brain doesn't naturally do:
- Initiating (registry gives exact first step)
- Working memory (external storage of thread state)
- Planning (Monday Protocol structures it)
- Time management (check-ins create boundaries)
- Perseverance (weekly slots maintain focus)
- Self-regulation (Claude initiates rhythm)

I bring: Problem-solving, organizational design, intellectual curiosity.

The system brings: Initiation, memory, sustained attention, regulation.

**Together = functional executive function.**

## When I Feel Lost

1. **Can't remember what I'm working on?** → Open Thread Registry, look at weekly slots
2. **Don't know where to start?** → Read "Next Micro-Action" for active thread
3. **Feel overwhelmed by too many things?** → Only 2 threads are active, everything else is dormant
4. **Lost track of the bigger plan?** → Open 90-Day Income Map, see the arc
5. **Forgot the system design?** → You're reading it right now

*This system was designed February 2026 specifically for my executive function profile. It's not a generic productivity system - it's infrastructure calibrated to my brain's actual capabilities and limitations.*
